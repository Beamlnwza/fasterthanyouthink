# Faster than you Think
Faster than you Think is a web-based game that follows the style of the popular television show, 24 games, but with 4 digits and a target number that can range from 0 to 99. The game has been built using React, Redux, and SCSS and does not require a backend API.

# Game Objective
The objective of the game is to use the four digits provided and perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, / and more) to calculate the target number within 24 seconds. The faster you can solve the puzzle, the more points you will earn. The game also features a leaderboard, allowing you to compete with other players from around the world for the top score.
